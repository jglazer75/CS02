re: Potential Hit For You

One of our biggest industries is food and beverage and the associated food system businesses. The first business we're looking at econcouraging is a chef and influencer looking to start a gourmet tater tot food cart. 

This chef is well-known in kitchens in the region, but the public doesn't know who he is. His girlfriend is a food influencer on TikTok (2M followers) and YouTube (1.2M). 

The cart will operate in the evenings near campus; it will travel during the week with spots on the West, Near West, Near East, North, and Near South during the week. 

They will focus on hip, gourmet tator tots. They will charge $15-20 per plate. A typical product for them is their Okonomyaki Tots, smashed thin, fried with cabbage and sauce. 

We'd like to hear how you might attract this business. I have 30 minutes with them later this week to talk to them about what we can offer. I might be able to get you a meeting with them. 

What are your thoughts?

re: RE: Potential Hit For You

MSN isn’t just a college town—it’s a food innovation hub with a hungry, engaged audience that craves what you’re offering: bold, shareable, and Instagrammable cuisine. Here’s why your gourmet tater tot cart belongs here, and how we can help you thrive:"

### Built-in Audience & Viral Potential

Campus & Young Professionals: The U-MSN area (your evening spot) has 45,000+ students and thousands of young professionals—your core demographic. They’re willing to pay for unique, high-quality street food (avg. spend: $12–$20/meal).
Influencer Synergy: Your girlfriend’s 3.2M+ social following aligns perfectly with Madison’s #3 ranking for TikTok engagement per capita in the Midwest. The city’s food scene is underserved by viral content—you’d fill that gap.
Event Culture: Madison hosts 50+ food/beverage festivals annually (e.g., Taste of Madison, Dane County Farmers’ Market). We can connect you to pop-up opportunities and sponsor collaborations.

### Low Overhead, High Visibility

Permitting & Logistics: The city offers streamlined food cart permits (avg. 2-week approval) and designated vending zones in your target neighborhoods (West, Near East, North). We’ll fast-track your applications.
Foot Traffic: Your proposed routes hit high-density areas with nightly foot traffic:

Campus: 10,000+ evening pedestrians (bars, libraries, dorms).
North: #1 neighborhood for 25–34yo residents (your price point fits their disposable income).
West/Near West: Tech workers from U-MSN Research Park (where my company is based) and Grand Systems—they love food trucks and will pay for premium options.

### Partnerships & Growth Opportunities

Tech & Marketing Support: My company, MSN Software, specializes in AI-driven social media analytics and local SEO. We’d offer pro bono tools to track your cart’s performance and optimize routes based on real-time demand.
Local Ingredient Pipeline: State is the #1 cheese producer in the U.S. and a top-5 state for potatoes. We’ll connect you to farm-to-cart suppliers (e.g., State Organics, State Cow Creamery) for locally sourced, high-margin ingredients.
Scaling Up: MSN's food accelerator programs (e.g., State Food) can help you transition from cart to brick-and-mortar if demand explodes. We’ve seen similar concepts (e.g., State Pizza, State Pancake Eatery) scale nationally from Madison roots.

### Why Now?

Post-Pandemic Boom: MSN’s food truck revenue grew 32% in 2024 (highest in the Midwest). The market is primed for niche, high-end offerings.
Cultural Fit: Your Okonomiyaki Tots tap into Madison’s love for global fusion (see: State Ramen, State Café). The city’s Asian population grew 40% since 2020, creating built-in demand for your flavors.

## Parties
*Armani*: Head chef with 9 years of industry experience; he started in fast food (Culvers) while in high school, then held two jobs as a prep cook at a fast casual (Chipotle) restaurant, and a line cook at a busy local tavern where he prepared a lot of bar food. He now wants to start his own food cart that will operate during lunch and late-night near the local university.

*Beatrice*: Armani's girlfriend. She is a very social media savvy and is a minor food influencer. She runs a food-based TikTok and YouTube channel, and runs local foodie tours on the weekends. She will run the cash register and social media for the company.

*Constance*: is Beatrice's mom. She is investing $40,000 for the food truck and initial operating expenses. Beatrice's mom has no experience in the food industry and will not be involved in the day-to-day business of the truck. She does want to have some control (basically, veto rights) over large purchases and input on big decisions, at least for the first few years of the truck. If they grow, she may be interested in investing more. Her day-job is as a family law attorney and she is very concerned about her daughter's involvement with Armani and keeping business and personal affairs separate.
